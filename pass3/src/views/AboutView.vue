          Hi there! I'm Karanveer Hoolash. I'm in my third-year Bachelor of Computer Science student with great optimism and, 
          willingness to learn and adapt to a fast-paced environment. 
          High commitment to goals evidenced through listed achievements. 
          Currently seeking graduate roles and job opportunities to apply and enrich existing skill sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish to highlight that I form part of the Golden Key International Honour Society, 
          which is eligible to the top 15% of students based on academic merit. 
          Being a member of this society has allowed me to participate in numerous leadership webinars with world leaders sharing their 
          life experiences and success stories. 
          Additionally, I am a Deakin Vice-Chancellor scholar which makes me form part of the Vice-Chancellorâ€™s Professional Excellence Program (VCPEP). Through the VCPEP, I have been able to upskill myself through personal challenges, which include indoor skydiving and surfing. Professional challenges in the program enabled me to work collaboratively with other scholars on real-world projects with companies such as Deloitte Australia and PwC Australia.
